SECTION B-10 Marks.	
Data or packet processing in a transmission path (from source to destination) involves 
multiple layers and components. These handle the encapsulation, routing, transmission, 
decapsulation, and delivery of the packet according to networking protocols like the OSI 
Model or TCP/IP stack. 
Provide the needed flowchart diagram for the above process and list all the components involved
